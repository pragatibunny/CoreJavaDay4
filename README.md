Circle 

Square 

Rectangle

Circle  

Enter the radius  

25  

Area of Circle is 1962.50 

 2. A Java interface can only contain method signatures and fields. The interface can be used to achieve polymorphism. In this problem, you will practice your knowledge on interfaces. 

You are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature int divisor_sum(int n). You need to write a class called MyCalculator which implements the interface. 

divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and return the sum of all its divisors. For example divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3 and 6, so divisor_sum should return 12. The value of n will be at most 1000. 

Read the partially completed code in the editor and complete it. You just need to write the MyCalculator class only. Your class shouldn't be public. 

Sample Input 

6 

Sample Output 

I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic 

12 

Explanation 

Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6. 1+2+3+6=12. 

 

3.Create an abstract class named Card with the following protected attributes / member variables. 

 String holderName; 

 String cardNumber; 

 String expiryDate; 

 Include appropriate getters and setters. 

 Include appropriate constructors. In the 3-argument constructor, the order of the arguments is holderName, cardNumber, expiryDate. 

 Create a class named MembershipCard. The class MembershipCard is a derived class of Card. Include the following private attributes / member variables. 

 Integer rating 

 Include appropriate getters and setters. 

 Include appropriate constructors. In the 4-argument constructor, the order of the arguments is holderName, cardNumber, expiryDate, rating. 

 Create a class named PaybackCard. The class PaybackCard is a derived class of Card. Include the following private attributes / member variables. 

 Integer pointsEarned; 

 Double totalAmount; 

 Include appropriate getters and setters. 

 Include appropriate constructors. In the 5-argument constructor, the order of the arguments is holderName, cardNumber, expiryDate, pointsEarned, totalAmount. 

 Create another class called Main. In the method, create instances of the above classes and test the above classes. The card details are entered separated by a ‘|’. 

All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output. 

 Sample Input and Output 1: 

 Select the Card 

 1.Payback Card 

 2.Membership Card 

 1 

 Enter the Card Details: 

 Anandhi|12345|14/01/2020 

 Enter points in card 

 1000 

 Enter Amount 

 50000 

 Anandhi's Payback Card Details: 

 Card Number 12345 

 Points Earned 1000 

 Total Amount 50000.0 

 

4. The following Java applications contain errors. Point out the statement(s) that contain errors. Explain what each of the errors is, and how it can be fixed. 

public class OOPExercises { 

    public static void main(String[] args) { 

        A objA = new A(); 

        System.out.println("in main(): "); 

        System.out.println("objA.a = "+objA.a); 

        objA.a = 222; 

    } 

} 

 

public class A { 

    private int a = 100; 

    public void setA( int value) { 

        a = value; 

} 

    public int getA() { 

        return a; 

    }

5. Show the output of the following applications. 

public class OOPExercises { 

    public static void main(String[] args) { 

        FirstClass objA = new FirstClass(); 

        SecondClass objB = new SecondClass(); 

        System.out.println("in main(): "); 

        System.out.println("objA.a = "+objA.getFirstClass()); 

        System.out.println("objB.b = "+objB.getSecondClass()); 

        objA.setFirstClass (222); 

        objB.setSecondClass (333.33); 

        System.out.println("objA.a = "+objA.getFirstClass());

public class FirstClass { 

    int a = 100; 

    public FirstClass () { 

        System.out.println("in the constructor of class FirstClass: "); 

        System.out.println("a = "+a); 

        a = 333; 

        System.out.println("a = "+a); 

    } 

    public void setFirstClass( int value) { 

        a = value; 

    } 

    public int getFirstClass() { 

        return a; 

    } 

} //class FirstClass 

public class SecondClass { 

    double b = 123.45; 

    public SecondClass() { 

        System.out.println("-----in the constructor of class B: "); 

        System.out.println("b = "+b); 

        b = 3.14159; 

        System.out.println("b = "+b); 

    } 

    public void setSecondClass( double value) { 

        b = value; 

    } 

    public double getSecondClass() { 

        return b; 

    } 

} //class SecondClass 

 

6. 

public class OOPExercises { 

    static int a = 555; 

     

    public static void main(String[] args) { 

        A objA = new A(); 

        B objB1 = new B(); 

        A objB2 = new B(); 

        C objC1 = new C(); 

        B objC2 = new C(); 

        A objC3 = new C(); 

        objA.display(); 

        objB1.display(); 

        objB2.display(); 

        objC1.display(); 

        objC2.display();

public class A { 

    int a = 100; 

    public void display() { 

        System.out.printf("a in A = %d\n", a); 

    } 

} //class A 

public class B extends A {
